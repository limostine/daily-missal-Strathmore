<span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was
without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit
of God was moving over the face of the waters. And God said, &quot;Let there be
light&quot;; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good; and God
separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the
darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.
And God said, &quot;Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and
let it separate the waters from the waters.&quot; And God made the firmament
and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which
were above the firmament. And it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven.
And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. And God said,
&quot;Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and
let the dry land appear.&quot; And it was so. God called the dry land Earth,
and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it
was good. And God said, &quot;Let the earth put forth vegetation, plants
yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each
according to its kind, upon the earth.&quot; And it was so. The earth brought
forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees
bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that
it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. And God
said, &quot;Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the
day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and
years, and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light
upon the earth.&quot; And it was so. And God made the two great lights, the
greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; he made
the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light
upon the earth, to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the
light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening
and there was morning, a fourth day. And God said, &quot;Let the waters bring
forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the
firmament of the heavens.&quot; So God created the great sea monsters and every
living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their
kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was
good. And God blessed them, saying, &quot;Be fruitful and multiply and fill the
waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.&quot; And there was
evening and there was morning, a fifth day. And God said, &quot;Let the earth
bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle and creeping
things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.&quot; And it was so.
And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle
according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the ground according
to its kind. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, &quot;Let us make man
in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of
the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the
earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.&quot; So God
created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and
female he created them. And God blessed them, and God said to them, &quot;Be
fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over
the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing
that moves upon the earth.&quot; And God said, &quot;Behold, I have given you
every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every
tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. And to every beast
of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on
the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green
plant for food.&quot; And it was so. And God saw everything that he had made,
and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a
sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of
them. And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he
rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

And he said, &quot;Here am I.&quot; He said, &quot;Take your son, your only son
Isaac, whom you love, and go to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">land</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Moriah</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, and offer him
there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains of which I shall tell
you.&quot; So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his ass, and took two
of his young men with <span class=GramE>him,</span> and his son Isaac; and he
cut the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which
God had told him. On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place
afar off. Then Abraham said to his young men, &quot;Stay here with the ass; I
and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.&quot; And
Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and
he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together.
And Isaac said to his father Abraham, &quot;My father!&quot; And he said,
&quot;Here am I, my son.&quot; He said, &quot;Behold, the fire and the wood;
but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?&quot; Abraham said, &quot;God will
provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.&quot; So they went both
of them together. When they came to the place of which God had told him,
Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his
son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. Then Abraham put forth his hand,
and took the knife to slay his son. But the angel of the LORD called to him
from heaven, and said, &quot;Abraham, Abraham!&quot; And he said, &quot;Here am
I.&quot; He said, &quot;Do not lay your hand on the lad or do anything to him;
for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your
only son, from me.&quot; And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold,
behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and
took the ram, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. So
Abraham called the name of that place The LORD will provide; as it is said to
this day, &quot;On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.&quot; And the
angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven, and said,
&quot;By myself I have sworn, says the LORD, because you have done this, and
have not withheld your son, your only son, I will indeed bless you, and I will
multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is on
the seashore. And your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies, and
by your descendants shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves,

to go forward. Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and

Pharaoh and <span class=GramE>all his</span> host, his chariots, and his

And there was the cloud and the darkness; and the night passed without one
coming near the other all night. Then Moses stretched out his hand over the

the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. And the sons of <st1:country-region

them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his

looked down upon the host of the Egyptians, and discomfited the host of the
Egyptians, clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily; and the
Egyptians said, &quot;Let us flee from before <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region

Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its wonted

routed the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. The waters returned and covered
the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of Pharaoh that had followed
them into the sea; not so much as one of them remained. But the sons of <st1:country-region

the nations to which you came. And I will vindicate the holiness of my great
name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned

cleanse you. A new heart I will give <span class=GramE>you,</span> and a new
spirit I will put within you; and I will take out of your flesh the heart of
stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and
