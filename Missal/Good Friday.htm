prosper, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high. As many were
astonished at him-- his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance, and
his form beyond that of the sons of men--<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>so shall he startle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because
of him; for that which has not been told them they shall see, and that which
they have not heard they shall understand. Who&nbsp;has believed what we have
heard? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? For he grew up before
him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or
comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.
He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with
grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we
esteemed him not. Surely&nbsp;he has borne our&nbsp;griefs and carried our
sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.&nbsp; But
he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon
him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are
healed.&nbsp; All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to
his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was
oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that
is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is dumb, so
he opened not his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as
for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the
living, stricken for the transgression of my people? And&nbsp;they made his
grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no
violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the will of the LORD
to bruise him; he has put him to grief; when he makes himself an offering for
sin, he shall see his offspring, he shall prolong his days; the will of the
LORD shall prosper in his hand; he shall see the fruit of the travail of his
soul and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,
make many to be accounted righteous; and he shall bear their iniquities.
Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the
spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul to death, and was
numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and made
intercession for the transgressors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our
confession. For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our
weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet
without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that
we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. In the days of his
flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears,
to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard for his godly
fear. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and
being made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>At that time: Jesus went forth
with his disciples across the Kidron valley, where there was a garden, which he
and his disciples entered. Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place;
for Jesus often met there with his disciples. So Judas, procuring a band of
soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there
with lanterns and torches and weapons. Then Jesus, knowing all that was to
befall him, came forward and said to them, &quot;Whom do you seek?&quot; They
answered him, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth.&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;I am
he.&quot; Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. When he said to
them, &quot;I am he,&quot; they drew back and fell to the ground. Again he
asked them, &quot;Whom do you seek?&quot; And they said, &quot;Jesus of
Nazareth.&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;I told you that I am he; so, if you seek
me, let these men go.&quot; This was to fulfil the word which he had spoken,
&quot;Of those whom you gave me I lost not one.&quot; Then Simon Peter, having
a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's slave and cut off his right ear.
The slave's name was Malchus. Jesus said to Peter, &quot;Put your sword into
its sheath; shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?&quot; So
the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews seized
Jesus and bound him. First they led him to Annas; for he was the father-in-law
of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. It was Caiaphas who had given
counsel to the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the
people. Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. As this
disciple was known to the high priest, he entered the court of the high priest
along with Jesus, while Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple,
who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the maid who kept the
door, and brought Peter in. The maid who kept the door said to Peter, &quot;Are
not you also one of this man's disciples?&quot; He said, &quot;I am not.&quot;
Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold,
and they were standing and warming themselves; Peter also was with them,
standing and warming himself. The high priest then questioned Jesus about his
disciples and his teaching. Jesus answered him, &quot;I have spoken openly to
the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews
come together; I have said nothing secretly. Why do you ask me? Ask those who
have heard me, what I said to them; they know what I said.&quot; When he had
said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying,
&quot;Is that how you answer the high priest?&quot; Jesus answered him,
&quot;If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong; but if I have spoken
rightly, why <span class=GramE>do you</span> strike me?&quot; Annas then sent
him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. Now Simon Peter was standing and warming
himself. They said to him, &quot;Are not you also one of his disciples?&quot;
He denied it and said, &quot;I am not.&quot; One of the servants of the high
priest, a kinsman of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, &quot;Did I
not see you in the garden with him?&quot; Peter again denied it; and at once
the cock crowed. Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the
praetorium. It was early. They themselves did not enter the praetorium, so that
they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover. So Pilate went out to
them and said, &quot;What accusation do you bring against this man?&quot; They
answered him, &quot;If this man were not an evildoer, we would not have handed
him over.&quot; Pilate said to them, &quot;Take him yourselves and judge him by
your own law.&quot; The Jews said to him, &quot;It is not lawful for us to put
any man to death.&quot; This was to fulfil the word which Jesus had spoken to
show by what death he was to die. Pilate entered the praetorium again and
called Jesus, and said to him, &quot;Are you the King of the Jews?&quot; Jesus
answered, &quot;Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you
about me?&quot; Pilate answered, &quot;Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the
chief priests have handed you over to me; what have you done?&quot; Jesus
answered, &quot;My kingship is not of this world; if my kingship were of this
world, my servants would fight, that I might not be handed over to the Jews;
but my kingship is not from the world.&quot; Pilate said to him, &quot;So you
are a king?&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;You say that I am a king. For this I
was born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth.
Every one who is of the truth hears my voice.&quot; Pilate said to him,
&quot;What is truth?&quot; After he had said this, he went out to the Jews
again, and told them, &quot;I find no crime in him. But you have a custom that
I should release one man for you at the Passover; will you have me release for
you the King of the Jews?&quot; They cried out again, &quot;Not this man, but
Barabbas!&quot; Now Barabbas was a robber. Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged
him. And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and
arrayed him in a purple robe; they came up to him, saying, &quot;Hail, King of
the Jews!&quot; and struck him with their hands. Pilate went out again, and
said to them, &quot;See, I am bringing him out to you, that you may know that I
find no crime in him.&quot; So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and
the purple robe. Pilate said to them, &quot;Behold the man!&quot; When the
chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, &quot;Crucify him, <span
class=GramE>crucify</span> him!&quot; Pilate said to them, &quot;Take him
yourselves and crucify him, for I find no crime in him.&quot; The Jews answered
him, &quot;We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he has made
himself the Son of God.&quot; When Pilate heard these words, he was the more
afraid; he entered the praetorium again and said to Jesus, &quot;Where are you
from?&quot; But Jesus gave no answer. Pilate therefore said to him, &quot;You
will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and
power to crucify you?&quot; Jesus answered him, &quot;You would have no power
over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore he who delivered me
to you has the greater sin.&quot; Upon this Pilate sought to release him, but
the Jews cried out, &quot;If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend;
every one who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar.&quot; When
Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment
seat at a place called The Pavement, and in Hebrew, Gabbatha. Now it was the
day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. He said to the
Jews, &quot;Behold your King!&quot; They cried out, &quot;Away with him, away
with him, crucify him!&quot; Pilate said to them, &quot;Shall I crucify your
King?&quot; The chief priests answered, &quot;We have no king but Caesar.&quot;
Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus, and he went
out, bearing his own cross, to the place called the place of a skull, which is
called in Hebrew Golgotha. There they crucified him, and with him two others,
one on <span class=GramE>either side, and</span> Jesus between them. Pilate
also wrote a title and put it on the cross; it read, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth,
the King of the Jews.&quot; Many of the Jews read this title, for the place
where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in
Latin, and in Greek. The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate,
&quot;Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, '<span class=GramE>This</span>
man said, I am King of the Jews.'&quot; Pilate answered, &quot;What I have
written I have written.&quot; When the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took
his garments and made four parts, one for each soldier; also his tunic. But the
tunic was without seam, woven from top to bottom; so they said to one another,
&quot;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.&quot;
This was to fulfil the scripture, &quot;They parted my garments among them, and
for my clothing they cast lots.&quot; So the soldiers did this. But standing by
the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of
Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he
loved standing near, he said to his mother, &quot;Woman, behold, your
son!&quot; Then he said to the disciple, &quot;Behold, your mother!&quot; And
from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. After this Jesus, knowing
that all was now finished, said (to fulfil the scripture), &quot;I
thirst.&quot; A bowl full of vinegar stood there; so they put a sponge full of
the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the
vinegar, he said, &quot;It is finished&quot;; and he bowed his head and gave up
his spirit. Since it was the day of Preparation, in order to prevent the bodies
from remaining on the cross on the <span class=GramE>sabbath</span> (for that
sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken,
and that they might be taken away. So the soldiers came and broke the legs of
the <span class=GramE>first,</span> and of the other who had been crucified
with him; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they
did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear,
and at once there came out blood and water. He who saw it has borne
witness--his testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth--<span
class=GramE>that</span> you also may believe. For these things took place that
the scripture might be fulfilled, &quot;Not a bone of him shall be
broken.&quot; And again another scripture says, &quot;They shall look on him
whom they have pierced.&quot; After this Joseph of Arimathea, who was a
disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he
might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him leave. So he came and
took away his body. Nicodemus also, who had at first come to him by night, came
bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds' weight. They
took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the
burial custom of the Jews. Now in the place where he was crucified there was a
garden, and in the garden a new tomb where no one had ever been laid. So
because of the Jewish day of Preparation, as the tomb was close at hand, they
laid Jesus there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
